# Dead Ends — Development Plan

> **Purpose:** Eliminate every place in the platform where the UI promises a feature
> to the user but the underlying code is missing, stubbed, or hardcoded.
>
> Items are grouped into four phases by effort and type of fix. Each phase can be
> worked independently. Phase 1 and 2 items are pure wiring — no new pages required.
> Phase 3 and 4 items require new components or non-trivial new logic.
>
> Last updated: April 2026 — Phases 1, 2, and 3 complete. Phase 4 is the active work queue.

## Phase 1 — Honest UI ✅ All complete

### P1-1 — Fix fake "Request to Join" toast  ✅ Fixed
`useContainerActions.ts` deleted (was never imported anywhere — the stub was dead code).
Migration `20260427000003` creates `circle_members` and `container_memberships` tables
with correct RLS. `ApplicationForm.tsx` now writes to the real tables.

### P1-2 — Fix My Links dead action buttons  ✅ Fixed
`handleEnrichSingle` and `handleDeleteContent` are present in `MyContentsPage.tsx`.
Add folder wired to folder creation flow.

### P1-3 — Fix missing WhatsApp edit button on My Basics  ✅ Fixed
`ContactTab.tsx` is itself an edit form with a Save button — no separate Edit Profile
button is needed.

### P1-4 — Fix My Circles "Create Circle" button  ✅ Fixed
Button navigates to `/circle-admin` which contains the full circle creation flow.

### P1-5 — Fix Events RSVP handler  ✅ Fixed
`RSVPActions` component handles RSVP with real DB writes to `session_attendance`
and `events.attendee_ids`.

### P1-6 — Fix Notifications "Load More" button  ✅ Fixed
Button calls `fetchNotifications(page + 1)` with correct pagination logic.

---

## Phase 2 — Real data ✅ All complete

### P2-1 — Fix My Growth pathway progress tracker  ✅ Fixed
`pathway_step_completions` table created (migration `20260427000002`).
`PathwayDetailPage` loads persisted completions on mount. Each step shows correct
state: completed, pending admin review, or not started.

### P2-2 — Fix library document counts and "Shared with Me" filter  ✅ Fixed
Auto-generated libraries now apply `filter_rules` (document_type, intended_audience,
tags[]) as a live count query. "Shared with Me" queries user's member circle IDs and
uses `overlaps` on `documents.circle_ids`, excluding the user's own docs. Same fix
applied in `LibraryDetailPage`.

### P2-3 — Fix hardcoded `recentActivity = 0` stats  ✅ Fixed
`MyAdminDashboard` counts `membership_states` + `container_memberships` (circle join
requests) in the last 30 days. `CircleAdminPage` counts posts across the admin's circles
in the last 30 days.

### P2-4 — Fix `isFavorited` hardcoded to `false` in My Documents  ✅ Fixed
`MyDocumentsPage` fetches `favoritedDocIds` from `content_favorites` on mount and
sets correct state on each document card.

### P2-5 — Fix Book topic loss on edit  ✅ Fixed
`handleEditBook` now awaits a fetch of existing topics from `content_topics` before
opening the dialog. `TopicSelector` added to the edit form. Save always syncs topics.

---

## Phase 3 — Missing pages ✅ All resolved

### P3-1 — Build StandupDetailPage  ✅ Already existed
`src/app/components/standup/StandupDetailPage.tsx` exists and is registered
at `/standups/:slug` in App.tsx. Was a false alarm in the original audit.

### P3-2 — Build missing container create forms  ✅ Already existed
All three pages exist and are registered in App.tsx:
- `CreateTablePage.tsx` → `/tables/create`
- `CreatePitchPage.tsx` → `/pitches/create`
- `CreateBuildPage.tsx` → `/builds/new`
False alarms in the original audit.

### P3-3 — Build Market Search page  ✅ Built April 2026
`src/app/pages/MarketSearchPage.tsx` created. Searches across all `market_placements`
by name, tagline, offering type, and market name. Deduplicates by offering, enriches
with company/owner names. Registered at `/markets/search`.

### P3-4 — Build Discover Guide page  ✅ Built April 2026
`src/app/pages/DiscoverGuidePage.tsx` created. 7-section guide with tips panel per
section, quick-tips strip, and related areas row. Registered at `/help/discover`.

## Phase 4 — Missing features requiring new logic or design
*Features that are visible in the UI or advertised to users but have no
implementation beneath them.*

### P4-1 — Implement drag-and-drop reordering
Three places show a `GripVertical` drag handle icon with no drag logic:
- Edit Company Companion view
- Event Companions list
- Playlists (`PlaylistDetailPage.tsx` / `PlaylistsPage.tsx`)

**Fix:** Implement using `@dnd-kit/core` (already a common React drag library) or
`react-beautiful-dnd`. On drop, update `order_index` for the reordered items via
an upsert. The `JourneyManagement` component likely already uses a drag pattern
that can be referenced.
**Effort:** 1–2 days (shared drag hook + wire into all three locations)

---

### P4-2 — Add `is_public` toggle for skills and credentials on profile
**File:** `src/app/components/circle/CircleSettingsPage.tsx` and profile edit tabs
**Issue:** The public profile page correctly filters out private skills and credentials
where `is_public = false`, but there is no UI control anywhere that lets the user
actually set this flag. Once a skill or credential is created, there is no way to
make it private.
**Fix:** Add an `is_public` toggle (switch or visibility selector) to the skill and
credential edit/create forms in the profile edit tabs.
**Effort:** 2–3 hours

---

### P4-3 — Implement Moments comments
**Files:** `src/app/components/MomentsPage.tsx`,
`src/app/components/MomentsSettingsPage.tsx`
**Issue:** The `allow_comments` flag exists on moment records in the database
but no comment UI or data fetch is implemented. The setting is stored but
has no effect on what the user sees.
**Fix:** Build a `MomentComments` component — load `comments` table filtered
to `content_type = 'moment'` and `content_id`, render threaded list, add reply
input. Only show when `allow_comments = true`.
**Effort:** 1–2 days

---

### P4-4 — Implement Course Certificate of Completion
**File:** `src/app/components/CoursePlayerPage.tsx`
**Issue:** "Certificate of completion" is advertised on course enrollment cards and
the player sidebar shows a "Get Certificate" button on completion, but the button
only marks `completed_at` — no certificate is generated or issued.
**Options (in order of effort):**
1. **Simple PDF generation:** Use a browser `window.print()` / `@react-pdf/renderer`
   approach with a styled certificate template populated with user name, course name,
   and completion date. No DB change needed.
2. **Stored certificate record:** Add a `course_certificates` table, generate a
   unique certificate ID, store it, and provide a shareable verification URL.
**Effort:** Option 1: 1 day. Option 2: 2–3 days.

---

### P4-5 — Fix "Start from Scratch" for custom program/course creation
**Files:** `src/app/components/unified/CreateMethodSelector.tsx`,
`src/app/components/program/CreateProgramPage.tsx`
**Issue:** Selecting "Start from Scratch" routes the user back to the template
picker instead of opening a blank creation form. Users cannot create a custom
program without starting from a template.
**Fix:** The "Start from Scratch" path should bypass template selection and navigate
directly to the program/course creation form with no pre-filled template data.
**Effort:** 2–4 hours

## Priority Summary

| Phase | Items | Status |
|---|---|---|
| **Phase 1** — Honest UI | P1-1 through P1-6 | ✅ All complete |
| **Phase 2** — Real data | P2-1 through P2-5 | ✅ All complete |
| **Phase 3** — Missing pages | P3-1 through P3-4 | ✅ All complete (2 were false alarms, 2 built) |
| **Phase 4** — Missing features | P4-1 through P4-5 | ❌ All outstanding — active work queue |

**Phase 4 recommended order:**
1. P4-5 (Start from Scratch bug) — 2–4 hrs; blocks course/program creation without templates
2. P4-2 (skills/credentials visibility toggle) — 2–3 hrs; data already stored, just needs UI
3. P4-1 (drag-and-drop reordering) — 1–2 days; affects 3 places (Companion, Event Companions, Playlists)
4. P4-3 (Moments comments) — 1–2 days; `allow_comments` flag exists, needs comment UI
5. P4-4 (Course certificate) — start with Option 1 (browser print/PDF, 1 day) before considering Option 2
